## Quick start

The file picker component provides a native interface for users to browse and select files from their device. It supports various file types and offers customization options to fit different use cases.

<CodeGroup>
```kotlin filekit-dialogs
val file = FileKit.openFilePicker()
```

```kotlin filekit-dialogs-compose
val launcher = rememberFilePickerLauncher { file ->
    // Handle the file
}

Button(onClick = { launcher.launch() }) {
    Text("Pick a file")
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Selection mode

Select one or multiple files using the `mode` parameter.
- `Single` - Allows the user to select a single file.
- `Multiple()` - Allows the user to select multiple files.

<CodeGroup>
```kotlin filekit-dialogs
val files = FileKit.openFilePicker(mode = FileKitMode.Multiple())
```

```kotlin filekit-dialogs-compose
val launcher = rememberFilePickerLauncher(
    mode = FileKitMode.Multiple()
) { files ->
    // Handle the files
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Filter by type

Filter the files by their type using the `type` parameter. You can pick different types of files with `FileKitType`:
- `Image`: Pick an image file.
- `Video`: Pick a video file.
- `ImageAndVideo`: Pick an image or a video file.
- `File()`: Pick any file. It is the default type. It's possible to specify a list of extensions.

<CodeGroup>
```kotlin filekit-dialogs
val file = FileKit.openFilePicker(type = FileKitType.File(listOf("pdf", "docx")))
```

```kotlin filekit-dialogs-compose
val launcher = rememberFilePickerLauncher(
    type = FileKitType.File(extensions = listOf("pdf", "docx"))
) { file ->
    // Handle the pdf or docx file
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>On Android and iOS, using Image, Video or ImageAndVideo FileKitType will open a gallery picker. [Read more here.](/dialogs/gallery-picker)</Info>

## Customizing the dialog

You can customize the dialog by setting the title, the initial directory and some settings relative to the platform.

<CodeGroup>
```kotlin filekit-dialogs
val file = FileKit.openFilePicker(
    title = "Custom title",
    directory = PlatformFile("/custom/initial/path"),
    dialogSettings = FileKitDialogSettings.createDefault()
)
```

```kotlin filekit-dialogs-compose
val launcher = rememberFilePickerLauncher(
    title = "Custom title",
    directory = PlatformFile("/custom/initial/path"),
    dialogSettings = FileKitDialogSettings.createDefault()
) { file ->
    // Handle the file
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Read more about [dialog settings](/dialogs/dialog-settings) to customize the dialog for each platform.

<Note>
  **macOS System Appearance**

  On macOS, to ensure the file picker dialog uses the system's theme (light or dark), you may need to set a system property at the start of your application:

  ```kotlin
  System.setProperty("apple.awt.application.appearance", "system")
  ```

  This is typically done in your `main` function, before the application window is created.
